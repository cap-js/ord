# CDS Plugin for ORD

## About this project

This plugin adds support for the [Open Resource Discovery](https://sap.github.io/open-resource-discovery/) (ORD) protocol for CAP based applications. 
When you add the ORD plugin, your application gains a single entry point, which allows to discover and gather machine-readable information or metadata about the application. 
You can use this information to construct a static metadata catalog or to perform a detailed runtime inspection of your actual system instances / system landscapes.

For more information, have a look at the [Open Resource Discovery](https://sap.github.io/open-resource-discovery/) page.
