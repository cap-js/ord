## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Development (Next Release)

**Data Product APIs - Version Suffix handling**

- CAP introduced a new pattern for data product related CDS services, that CDS service names that are suffixed with `.v1` or `.v2` will take the `.v1` version as major version and remove this suffix for the ORD-ID generation to avoid a duplicated version suffix in the ORD-ID (avoid `<namespace>:apiResource:<serviceName>.v1:v1`, but have it as `<namespace>:apiResource:<serviceName>:v1`).

**MCP API exposure** üîÑ:

- Support the exposure of MCP APIs through ORD as API Resources with API protocol `mcp` in addition to being regular API Resources for OData
- Ensure proper documentation and testing of exposed APIs

### Medium-term Development

**Java Runtime Parity** üîÑ:

- Complete Java implementation feature parity with Node.js version
- Ensure differentiation of ORD properties and defaults (like the path of an API resource) between CAP Java/Spring environment parameters and defaults from CAP Node.js environments
- Keep ORD properties that come from the CAP CDS/CSN model the same across the CAP Java and CAP Node.js implementation
- It is not clear, if the CAP Java support will be implemented in this repository
- Java build integration improvements
- Java authentication middleware

**Error Handling Enhancement** üìã:

- Better error messages for configuration issues
- Improved diagnostics for ORD generation failures
- Validation error reporting improvements
- Recovery mechanisms for partial failures

**Performance Optimization** üîÑ:

- Large CAP application handling improvements
- Memory usage optimization during generation
- Build time performance enhancements
- Caching strategies for repeated operations

**Integration Dependencies**:

- Dependency detection and modeling
- Proper ORD integration dependency structure
- Aspect and annotation handling

**Advanced Authentication** üìã:

- UCL-mTLS authentication implementation
- Certificate-based authentication
- Support UCL-mTLS authentication next to base authentication in parallel, to support different integration requirements.

### Long-term Vision

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations

**Performance Constraints** ‚ö†Ô∏è:

- Large CAP applications may experience slower build times
- Memory usage can be high for complex models
- No caching for repeated ORD generation operations
